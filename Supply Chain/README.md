## Technical Architecture

The enhanced dashboard follows a sophisticated multi-layered architecture designed to support scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. The architectural design principles emphasize separation of concerns, modular component design, and efficient data flow management to create a robust foundation for complex analytical operations.

### Core Architecture Components

The application architecture consists of several interconnected layers, each serving specific functional requirements while maintaining loose coupling with other components. The presentation layer handles user interface rendering and interaction management, utilizing Streamlit's component system enhanced with custom CSS and JavaScript for advanced interactivity. This layer is responsible for managing user inputs, displaying visualizations, and coordinating real-time updates across multiple dashboard components.

The business logic layer contains the core analytical functionality, implemented through specialized classes that handle data processing, metric calculations, and advanced analytics operations. The `EnhancedDataAnalyzer` class serves as the primary analytical engine, providing methods for complex data queries, performance metric calculations, and trend analysis. This layer abstracts the complexity of data operations from the presentation layer, enabling clean separation of concerns and improved code maintainability.

The data access layer manages all interactions with the underlying dataset, implementing efficient caching mechanisms and optimized query processing through DuckDB integration. This layer provides a consistent interface for data retrieval operations while handling performance optimization, error management, and data quality validation. The integration of DuckDB enables SQL-based queries on pandas DataFrames, combining the flexibility of Python data manipulation with the performance benefits of columnar database operations.

### Data Flow Architecture

The data flow architecture implements a sophisticated pipeline that transforms raw supply chain data into actionable business insights through multiple processing stages. The initial data ingestion stage handles file loading, data validation, and basic cleaning operations to ensure data quality and consistency. This stage implements comprehensive error handling mechanisms that gracefully manage missing files, corrupted data, and format inconsistencies.

The data transformation stage applies advanced analytical calculations, derives new metrics, and performs data enrichment operations that enhance the analytical value of the original dataset. This stage calculates performance indicators, efficiency ratios, risk assessments, and trend indicators that provide deeper insights into supply chain operations. The transformation pipeline is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy addition of new metrics and analytical calculations as business requirements evolve.

The visualization preparation stage optimizes data structures for efficient rendering, implements aggregation operations for summary visualizations, and prepares data formats that support interactive features such as cross-filtering and real-time updates. This stage ensures that visualization components receive data in the optimal format for rendering performance while maintaining the flexibility required for interactive operations.

### Component Architecture

### Data Loading and Processing Issues

Data loading issues may involve file format problems, data quality issues, or compatibility problems that prevent proper data ingestion and processing. Common data issues include missing or corrupted data files, incompatible data formats, and data quality problems such as missing values, inconsistent formatting, or invalid data types.

Data validation procedures include file existence verification, format compatibility checking, and data quality assessment that identify specific data problems and provide guidance for resolution. The validation process includes comprehensive error reporting that helps users understand data issues and implement appropriate corrections.

Data processing troubleshooting includes error handling for missing values, data type conversion issues, and calculation errors that may occur during metric computation and analytical operations. The troubleshooting process provides systematic approaches for identifying and resolving data processing problems while maintaining analytical integrity.

### User Interface and Interaction Issues

User interface issues may include layout problems, interactive element malfunctions, or browser compatibility issues that affect dashboard usability and user experience. Common interface issues include responsive design problems on different screen sizes, browser-specific rendering issues, and interactive element failures that prevent proper user interaction.

Interface troubleshooting procedures include browser compatibility testing, responsive design verification, and interactive element functionality testing that identify specific interface problems and provide resolution guidance. The troubleshooting process includes systematic testing procedures that verify proper operation across different browsers, devices, and screen configurations.

Interactive element troubleshooting includes event handling verification, cross-filtering functionality testing, and animation performance assessment that ensure proper operation of advanced interactive features. The troubleshooting process provides systematic approaches for identifying and resolving interaction problems while maintaining full dashboard functionality.
